        <p>Matthew Tyler Musto (born November 27, 1990), known professionally as blackbear, is an American hip hop recording artist, singer, songwriter and record producer from LA. Blackbear is best known for his rap and R&B-oriented music. He has collaborated with several musical artists such as Justin Bieber, G-Eazy, Mike Posner, James Blake, Maejor Ali, Machine Gun Kelly, Mod Sun, Rivers Cuomo, Childish Gambino, Pharrell Williams, and Linkin Park.</p>

      <div id="para2">
        <p>Blackbear first collaborated on Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend," a number two hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2012. Another big stride was taken the next year with Deadroses, a self-released full-length that registered on Billboard's Uncharted listing  of releases from upcoming artists. Deadroses featured the singles "IDFC" and "90210," featuring rapper G-Eazy. An EP of acoustic interpretations titled Dead followed soon after, before blackbear issued his sophomore set, Help, in 2015.</p>

        <p>The EPs Drink Bleach and Cashmere Noose both arrived in 2016, as did "STFU," the debut single from blackbear and Mike Posner's alternative hip-hop duo Mansionz. Two more Mansionz singles preceded the project's eponymous debut LP, released in March 2017. One month later, blackbear issued his third full-length album, Digital Druglord. Cybersex arrived at the end of the year, debuting in the Top 50. In 2018, in addition to collaborations with Mike Shinoda ("About You") and DVBBS ("IDWK"), he issued the solo single "The 1." In April of the following year, he issued his next album, the lengthy, 18-track Anonymous, which reached number 36 on the Billboard 200. Another standalone single, "Hot Girl Bummer," appeared a few months later.</p>
